    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Chicken biryani is a delicious Indian/Pakistani rice dish that's typically reserved for special occasions such as weddings, parties, or holidays such as Ramadan. It has a lengthy preparation, but the work is definitely worth it. For biryani, basmati rice is the ideal variety to use.</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>4 tablespoons vegetable oil, divided</li>
    <li>4 small potatoes, peeled and halved</li>
    <li>2 large onions, finely chopped</li>
    <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon minced fresh ginger root</li>
    <li>2 medium tomatoes, peeled and chopped</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
    <li>½ teaspoon chili powder</li>
    <li>½ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
    <li>½ teaspoon ground turmeric</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons plain yogurt</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh mint leaves</li>
    <li>½ teaspoon ground cardamom</li>
    <li>1 (2 inch) piece cinnamon stick</li>
    <li>3 pounds boneless, skinless chicken pieces cut into chunks</li>
</ul>
<h3>Rice</h3>
<ul>
    <li>1 pound basmati rice</li>
    <li>2 ½ tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
    <li>1 large onion, diced</li>
    <li>5 pods cardamom</li>
    <li>3 whole cloves</li>
    <li>1 (1 inch) piece cinnamon stick</li>
    <li>½ teaspoon ground ginger</li>
    <li>1 pinch powdered saffron</li>
    <li>4 cups chicken stock</li>
    <li>1 ½ teaspoons salt</li>
</ul>
<h2>Directions</h2>
<h3>Step 1</h3>
<p>Gather all ingredients.</p>
<h3>Step 2</h3>
<p>Heat 2 tablespoons of oil in a large skillet. Fry potatoes in hot oil until lightly browned, about 3 to 5 minutes. Remove to a paper towel-lined plate to drain; set aside.</p>
<h3>Step 3</h3>
<p>Add remaining 2 tablespoons of oil to the skillet. Add onions, garlic, and fresh ginger; cook and stir until onion is soft and golden. Add tomatoes, salt, cumin, chili powder, pepper, and turmeric; cook, stirring constantly, for 5 minutes.</p>
<h3>Step 4</h3>
<p>Stir in yogurt, mint, ground cardamom, and cinnamon stick. Cover and cook over low heat, stirring occasionally, until tomatoes are cooked to a pulp. It may be necessary to add a little hot water if mixture becomes too dry and starts to stick to the pan.</p>
<h3>Step 5</h3>
<p>Add chicken and stir well to coat. Cover and cook over very low heat until chicken is tender, 35 to 45 minutes. There should only be a little very thick gravy left when chicken is finished cooking. If necessary cook uncovered for a few minutes to reduce the gravy.</p>
<h3>Step 6</h3>
<p>Meanwhile, make the rice: Wash rice well and drain in a colander for at least 30 minutes.</p>
<h3>Step 7</h3>
<p>Heat oil in a large skillet. Add onion; cook and stir until golden. Add cardamom pods, cloves, cinnamon stick, ground ginger, and saffron; stir in rice until coated with spices.</p>
<h3>Step 8</h3>
<p>Heat stock and salt in a medium pot until hot; pour over rice and stir well.</p>
<h3>Step 9</h3>
<p>Add chicken mixture and potatoes; stir gently to combine. Bring to a boil.</p>
<h3>Step 10</h3>
<p>Reduce heat to very low, cover with a tight-fitting lid, and steam for 20 minutes without lifting the lid or stirring.</p>
<h3>Step 11</h3>
<p>Spoon biryani onto a warm serving dish.</p>
